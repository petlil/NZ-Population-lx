# NZ-Population-lx
New Zealand population lx data visualised / sonified

The data used is the lx data of the New Zealand population from the late 19th to late 20th century. The lx of an age and year (i.e. 35 years old in 1905) is the number of hypothetical people who would survive to that age under that year's mortality rate (out of 100,000).

The dataset is obtained from Stats NZ's publicly available 'csv files for download' page under the name 'NZ complete cohort life tables'. 

The .csv file, and the two .png files should be placed in a folder titled 'assets', which should be placed in the same directory as 'p5.js'
